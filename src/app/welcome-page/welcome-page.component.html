        Obi-Wan's life prior to The Phantom Menace is portrayed mostly in Jude Watson's Jedi Apprentice and Jedi Quest
        series. The Jedi Apprentice books follow his adventures as Qui-Gon's Padawan. Notable events in the series
        include battling the Dark Jedi Xanatos and going on his first independent mission. The Jedi Quest books detail
        his adventures with Anakin in the years leading up to Attack of the Clones.

        His heroism just before and during the Clone Wars is portrayed in novels such as Outbound Flight, The
        Approaching Storm, and The Cestus Deception.

        Obi-Wan's life between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope is portrayed mostly in Jude Watson's The Last of the
        Jedi series. Set roughly a year after the fall of the Republic, the series follows Obi-Wan as he seeks out
        possible survivors of the Great Jedi Purge, most notably Anakin's former rival, Ferus Olin. The books also
        portray Obi-Wan adjusting to life as a hermit on Tatooine and quietly watching over Luke. He also discovers that
        Vader is still alive after seeing him on the Holonet, the galaxy's official news source.

        Obi-Wan appears in the final chapter of Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, set just after the events in Revenge
        of the Sith. He is also the protagonist in John Jackson Miller's novel Star Wars: Kenobi, which takes place
        during his exile on Tatooine.
